# Stat380Final
---

Final Project for Stat380 on Drowsy Driving classification. This for reproducing our results.

If you wish to repopulate the tables, run Models.qmd. YOU DO NOT NEED TO RENDER. 1.qmd and 2.qmd are there to construct a code appendix. Stat380Final.qmd is our actual report. Our final report was concatenated using Stat380Final.qmd, 1.qmd, and 2.qmd, rendered and combined in that order with Adobe Acrobat.

### **NOTE:** Reproducing this data might be extremely computationally expensive. Expect this to run for multiple hours.
